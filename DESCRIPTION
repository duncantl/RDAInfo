Package: RDAInfo
Version: 0-1.0
Title: Read summary of RDA  files and restore individual elements
Description: This reads RDA (version 3, XDR format) files 
  to get the names, types, lengths and positions/(offsets in the stream) of the
  top-level variables it contains.  It does this without reading/deserializing the actual values.
  It can also deserialize individual values.
  Both of these make it useful when dealing with very large Rda files, especially if we only
  want to find the names of the variables they contain, or want only a few objects from it.
  While written in R, for large Rda files, it is faster for answering certain questions
  that do not require restoring all the objects which is the only option the existing Rda deserialization
  code offers.
  It also provides an R implementation of the C code in serialize.c in the R source
  with which people can experiement, specifically extensions to the format.

Note: There are a few SEXP types that are not yet handled. Also, this does not read some RDA files
  eventhough they were written using the version 3, XDR format.
  Since it is R code, I encourage R programmers to explore adding this capability.
  See https://github.com/duncantl/LLDB_Scripting for an instrumentation utility I found useful
   for knowing the structure of a given Rda file.
  More interestingly, we have to figure out how to handle deserializing an object which includes
  references to objects that appear earlier in the Rda stream.  Since we skip past those to start
  reading the target object, any references will not be available. However, we can start reading
  from the start and deserialize only the references we need.  This can become recursive.
