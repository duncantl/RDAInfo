+ TEST SUITE

+ [test] Capture the references.
   + Need to them for symsxps, environments, PACKAGESXP, PERSISTSXP, NAMESPACESXP, EXTPTRSXP, WEAKREFSXP, ....
   + √ See Expression.rda.  The second call has "20" where a should be.


+ Handling character encoding.
   + The note in serialize.c "  strings without an encoding flag will be converted to the current native  encoding" indicates that the CHARSXP?/STRSXP may contain an encoding instruction.

+ √ When read the entire file in toc mode, then access an object, the second read/pass will add references that are already
  in the references.
  + They don't do any harm, but are unnecessary.
     + the second "pass" still uses the original indices so finds the original  insertions not the new ones.
  + perhaps toc() "locks" the environment as it knows it has done a pass over the entire file
      + addRef() would check for this lock add not add new references


+ References at the toplevel
   + save(a = obj,  b = obj) - same object.
   + capture concept that restoring b means binding to the value of a.

+ 
   + CLOSXP with no default values, attributes, ...
   + calls with missing arguments
   + [leave] name for object in simpleFunction.  Seems to be 1,  not simpleFun.  This is how it is printing when there is only one object.  Fix when combine all the columns.

+ get file name from the connection
   + summary(con)$description
   + add it to the RDAToc object returned by toc() if we start with a connection.
     + already do add file so that would be the connection and we can reopen it
       if we are using it in, e.g., [[ or [

+ Test
   + EXTPTRSXP =    22    ,
      + with attributes - not supposed to put them on the externalptr itself, but legal.
         + `z = toc("inst/sampleRDA/externalpointer_withAttrs.rda")`
         + finishes the file but has 2 entries.

+ √ Registering each symsxp twice. and in pairs, i.e., not interspersed by others.
   + solved - readSYMSXP() was calling readTag() and then registering the result. But readTag() was also registering the result.

+ √ combine the data.frames when printing.

+ √ Implement [[ integer for RDAToc.

+ √ Fix putting formals() on the function in readFunction when not skipping value.
